# D3 topics that I need to check

## TODO in general

- [] I need to create a draft on the assessment portal. Before application it's recommended to coordinate with my RM or PTL, to get their approval and support.
- [] Need to create a self-presentation PPT for the assessment. When I'll create the request there will be a template file for it.
- [] Check:
  - [] Optional
  - [] Stream operations
  - [] Why there is an int stream and double stream
  - [] Java future
  - [] Java executor
  - [] Java executor service
  - [] Threads
  - [] Microservice vs Monolith service
  - [] Maven vs Gradle
  - [] SQL vs NoSQL, what type of databases do I know
  - [] SDLC
  - [] CI/CD
  - [] Testing/Testing pyramid
  - [] The FIRST principle of testing (Fast, Isolated/Independent, Repeatable, Self-validation, Thorough)
  - [] Java garbage collector
  - [] Build tools

## TODO for the next session

- [x] Check this [Brooks law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)
- [x] Spring containerization
- [x] Spring beans, what is a bean? And what is a java enterprise bean?
- [x] Spring bean scopes
- [x] **Difference between Spring vs SpringBoot** -> most important
- [ ] Spring Security, briefly go through it
- [ ] Protocols -> IP, TCP, UDP, TLS, SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP
- [x] **SOAP vs REST** -> important
- [ ] **JMM, java memory model** -> ongoing process **in depth for 09/23**
- [ ] **The garbage collector, CMS** -> ongoing process

## Bigger topics

- Agile method -> Daily, planning, review, retro. The retro marks the end of the sprint. [Useful link](https://www.scrum.org/)
- Waterfall method
- Scrum team:
  - Scrum master -> he could be also a developer while being a scrum master. He is a ceremonial master. He is a consultant. He can work for multiple teams. He wards off any issues that can stop the team from creating value.
  - Developer -> testers, BA, developer everybody who does technical work. The developer's responsibility is to create something worth value.
  - Product Owner -> He does the communication between the team and the stakeholders. The product owner represents the stakeholders and the developer team as well. He only needs to attend the sprint review.
- Spring code that I should check:
  - Servlet Context
  - Session (session bean scope)
  - Request/Response life cycle
  - Listener -> how does it work
  - Aspect -> what is it, how does it work

## Things that I missed in a topic
- JMM
  - You can approach it from garbage collector, and where you are storing the data.
  - L3 cache, this is the memory in the CPU shared between the cores.
