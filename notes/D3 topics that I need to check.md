## Bigger topics

- Agile method -> Daily, planning, review, retro. The retro marks the end of the sprint. [Useful link](https://www.scrum.org/)
- Waterfall method
- Scrum team:
  - Scrum master -> he could be also a developer while being a scrum master. He is a ceremonial master. He is a consultant. He can work for multiple teams. He wards off any issues that can stop the team from creating value.
  - Developer -> testers, BA, developer everybody who does technical work. The developer's responsibility is to create something worth value.
  - Product Owner -> He does the communication between the team and the stakeholders. The product owner represents the stakeholders and the developer team as well. He only needs to attend the sprint review.
